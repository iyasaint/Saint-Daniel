The

2
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:13,360
hey guys Welcome to modern javascript from the beginning this is not a course on frameworks or libraries

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,940
or how to use a query.

4
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:19,450
This is a course on learning and building things with pure modern Javascript.

5
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,110
So who is this course for.

6
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,930
For absolutely everyone.

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,380
We're starting from absolute scratch the first section is all about fundamentals like data types arrays

8
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:33,880
loops functions all the basics that you need to know and explained in a way that doesn't suggest that

9
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,800
you know anything about programming.

10
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:40,210
Now just because the first section is geared towards beginners doesn't mean that this is a beginner's

11
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:41,050
course.

12
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:47,320
From there we're going to learn all about the DOM how to manipulate interfaces events Asynchronous JavaScript

13
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,660
with Ajax and fetch promises and other new features.

14
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:58,120
We're going to learn about object oriented programming both E.S. five prototypes and as 2015 classes

15
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:04,060
we'll also learn about things like regular expressions javascript patterns and much more.

16
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:10,930
Now I carefully formatted this course in a way that is modular it has modular learning sections where

17
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:17,580
we really dig into the code and use the console for output to learn specific aspects of the language.

18
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:23,440
But I also included about 10 different projects that range in size that allow you to build stuff based

19
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,690
on what you've learned.

20
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:29,260
So some are very small many projects others take up to 12 lectures.

21
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:35,550
The last project will actually be an entire front end to arrest API using no framework whatsoever.

22
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:43,150
In fact we'll even build a custom HGP library that will build using the fecche API along with a sink

23
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,380
in a way.

24
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:48,860
So why take this course well first of all you're going to learn modern javascript from scratch.

25
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,970
And I didn't format this like many other courses out there where it's all older yes 5 code and then

26
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:59,650
a little sprinkle of iOS 6 at the end you're going to learn the core fundamentals that have been around

27
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:02,170
forever along with the new features.

28
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:08,940
All modern browsers now support 95 percent of as 2015 are also called iOS 6.

29
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:15,040
So things like leten Konst aero functions template literals we're going to utilize these features throughout

30
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,830
the course and then when we do get to something that the browser doesn't support such as EIAS 20:15

31
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:27,250
modules I'm going to show you how to compile your code with web pack and babbel down to something that

32
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,850
all browsers can run.

33
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,500
OK another reason is because frameworks have basically taken over.

34
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,810
People are learning frameworks before the actual language.

35
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:41,260
This course will teach you how to build things without reactor angular and at the same time give you

36
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:44,880
more skills to be able to understand how those frameworks operate.

37
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:45,360
OK.

38
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:49,380
You're also going to learn your way around the DOM without having to use a query.

39
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:54,880
There's almost no need for a query any more vanilla javascript is more than capable of manipulating

40
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,750
the DOM.

41
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:59,530
You'll also learn about structuring and design patterns.

42
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:04,000
So here's a list of some of the major topics that will cover in this course for absolute beginners.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,320
We have language fundamentals that will move to Dom and Appalachian events with no query S-5 and ESX

44
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:17,440
object oriented programming Asynchronous JavaScript with Ajax and callbacks as well as newer standards

45
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:25,240
like fecche promises and sync away things like Error handling regular expressions local in-session storage

46
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:32,610
aero functions maps insets popular javascript patterns and a bunch of projects to go with all of it.

47
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:39,310
So some of the included projects will include a task list with DOM manipulation as well as local storage

48
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:47,050
to persist the data alone calculator a number guessing game in object oriented application on creating

49
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:55,230
book lists even build a custom HTP library first with Ajax and callbacks and then we'll move on to fetch

50
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:02,740
promises in a sink away and then we'll move on to building API projects like the get hub finder using

51
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,960
the Get hub API.

52
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:11,530
A weather app using the Weather Underground API will build a pretty large project using the module pattern

53
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:20,560
which will track calories and then we'll build a complete front end to arrest API with ESX modules using

54
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,140
web pack and babbel And then along the way we'll have some many projects like a Chuck Norris job generator

55
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:33,760
to look at Ajax and how that works and externally pie's a profile scroller to give you an example of

56
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:39,960
how to use E-6 iterators and then we'll build a little state pattern interface where we can switch from.

57
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:45,330
Will create a bootstrap theme and we can switch pages based on the state.

58
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:49,760
All right so these are some of the things that we'll learn throughout the course and these other things

59
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,940
that listed here are things that we're not going to completely focus on and I'm going to fully explain

60
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:58,000
but these are skills you may pick up some more each time balance.

61
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,630
SS We're going to use frameworks like bootstrap for materialized CSSA skeleton CSSA you're going to

62
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:12,740
learn more about each requests get requests post put delete rest AAPI eyes we're going to be using something

63
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:18,500
called Jason's server on the last project where we can create a fake rest API for our front end and

64
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,050
we'll build the front end using E-S 20:15 modules.

65
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:29,420
So we'll be using web pack and babbel to compile newer features of javascript down to S-5.

66
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,100
All right.

67
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:35,090
So hopefully you guys enjoy this course whether you're brand new to javascript and programming in general

68
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:38,940
or whether you're already in the field and you're looking to sharpen your skills.

69
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,050
Let's go ahead and get started.
